\section{Conclusion}
In this work, we have considered unary oritatami system at $\delta = 1$ and $\alpha = 1$.
A unary oritatami system at $\delta = 1$ and $\alpha = 2$ is able to make an infinity structure only in the case of zig-zag.
In the case of $\delta = 1$ and $\alpha \geq 3$ it is not able to yield any infinity structures.
In addition, a unary oritatami system at $\delta = 1$ and $\alpha = 2,3$ is not able to produce.
In the future, we are going to consider the case of $\alpha = 1$ and $\delta \geq 4$.
